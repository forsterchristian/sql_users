# sql_users
As a teacher, I need to create a lot of users for my MySQL-Database, and as a learner, instead of searching for a tool, I'll write one.

# Things I'm planing to to / need to learn
- how to read a .csv-file line by line
- how to extract the user-name, password, first name and gender from these lines in order to
- put out one .sql-file with SQL-Commands that create the new user (with rigths to SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT Data into tables of a certain database)
- put out one .txt-file with a few sentences for each user telling them where to go and what username and password they got

# Requirements
- should be written in Java
- a line in the .csv-file looks like:
username;password;firstname;lastname;somenumber;gender (gender says 'm' for male and 'w' for female)
